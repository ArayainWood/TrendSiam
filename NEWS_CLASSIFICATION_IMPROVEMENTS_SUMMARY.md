# 🏷️ News Classification System Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the news classification system in TrendSiam to significantly reduce misclassification to "Others" category and improve accuracy for gaming, entertainment, and other content types.

## 🎯 Problems Addressed

### Before Improvements:
- **Marvel Rivals** gameplay content was classified as "Others" instead of "Games"
- **Netflix trailers** were misclassified as "Others" instead of "Entertainment" 
- Many gaming-related videos fell into "Others" due to insufficient keyword coverage
- Streaming service content wasn't properly detected
- Limited fallback rules led to higher "Others" category usage

### After Improvements:
- ✅ Comprehensive gaming keyword detection (300+ terms)
- ✅ Enhanced streaming service recognition
- ✅ Better channel-based classification
- ✅ Improved fallback rules with multiple layers
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging misclassifications

## 🔧 Key Enhancements Made

### 1. **Expanded Gaming Keywords (300+ terms)**
```python
# Added comprehensive gaming coverage:
- Popular games: 'marvel rivals', 'fortnite', 'minecraft', 'roblox', 'valorant'
- Gaming terms: 'gameplay', 'walkthrough', 'speedrun', 'mod', 'beta'
- Platforms: 'playstation', 'xbox', 'nintendo switch', 'steam', 'epic games'
- Content types: 'let's play', 'tutorial', 'review', 'tips', 'tricks'
- Community terms: 'gamer', 'esports', 'competitive', 'streaming'
```

### 2. **Enhanced Entertainment & Streaming Detection**
```python
# Comprehensive streaming platform coverage:

- Content types: 'trailer', 'documentary', 'series', 'episode', 'season'
- Music terms: 'artist', 'songwriter', 'collaboration', 'remix', 'live performance'
```

### 3. **Improved Weighted Scoring System**
```python
field_weights = {
    'title': (title, 3),          # Title gets 3x weight
    'channel': (channel, 2.5),    # Channel gets 2.5x weight (increased)
    'summary_en': (summary_en, 2), # English summary gets 2x weight
    'summary': (summary, 1.5),    # Thai summary gets 1.5x weight
    'description': (description, 1) # Description gets 1x weight
}
```

### 4. **Enhanced Fallback Rules**
```python
# Multi-layer fallback system:
1. Channel-based patterns (gaming, entertainment, news, education)
2. Title-based indicators (gameplay, trailer, vs, tournament)
3. Content-specific detection with detailed logging
```

### 5. **Comprehensive Logging**
```python
# Enhanced debugging information:
- Classification source tracking (which field triggered the decision)
- Matched keywords and their sources
- Field-specific scores
- Detailed fallback rule triggers
- Content availability analysis
```
