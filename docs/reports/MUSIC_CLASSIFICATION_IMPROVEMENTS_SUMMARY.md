# Music Classification Improvements Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the news categorization logic in `app.py` to correctly classify music-related content under "Entertainment" instead of "Games/Anime", addressing misclassification issues while preserving existing functionality.

## Problem Statement
- Music content (lyrics videos, official MVs, audio tracks, covers) was being misclassified under "Games/Anime"
- Need to improve classification precision for music content
- Maintain existing classification logic for other categories
- Avoid breaking current layout or features

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Entertainment Keywords (Lines 4210-4260)
**Comprehensive Music Coverage:**
- **Core Music Terms**: lyrics, music video, official mv, audio, cover, acoustic, song, single, album
- **Artist Industry Terms**: artist, musician, composer, songwriter, producer, featuring, remix
- **Music Genres**: pop, rock, jazz, kpop, thai pop, indie, ballad, electronic
- **Popular Artists**: BTS, BLACKPINK, Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, etc.
- **Thai Music**: ‡∏•‡∏π‡∏Å‡∏ó‡∏∏‡πà‡∏á, ‡∏•‡∏π‡∏Å‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∏‡∏á, GMM Grammy, RS Music, Kamikaze
- **Streaming Platforms**: Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, SoundCloud

### 2. Early Music Detection Function (Lines 4178-4224)
**Intelligent Pre-Classification:**
```python
def is_music_content():
    """Detect if content is clearly music-related to prevent misclassification."""
```

**Detection Logic:**
- **Title Pattern Matching**: "official mv", "lyrics", "audio", "cover", "acoustic"
- **Channel Recognition**: Record labels, official artist channels, music distributors
- **Artist + Music Combination**: Detects artist indicators + music keywords
- **Early Return**: Immediately classifies as Entertainment if music detected

### 3. Gaming Classification Exclusion (Lines 4260-4275)
**Music Exclusion Logic:**
```python
def is_gaming_but_not_music(content_title, content_channel):
    """Prevents music content from being classified as gaming."""
```

**Exclusion Keywords**: lyrics, official mv, music video, audio, cover, acoustic, song, album

### 4. Enhanced Fallback Rules (Lines 4395-4420)
**Improved Channel Detection:**
- Added music record labels: Sony Music, Universal Music, Warner Music
- Enhanced title patterns: lyrics, audio, cover, remix, featuring
- Better recognition of official artist channels
